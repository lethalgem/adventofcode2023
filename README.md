# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to our collaborative repository for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges! This project is a fun and engaging way for us to sharpen our coding skills and tackle interesting problems together during the festive season.

## Overview
The Advent of Code is an annual coding event that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, two challenges are released: the second challenge builds upon the first. This repository is a space for each of us to share our solutions, learn from each other, and celebrate our progress.

## Repository Structure
To maintain organization and clarity, we'll structure the repository as follows:

- Each participant will have a dedicated folder named after their username (e.g., `/johnDoe`).
- Inside your folder, create a subfolder for each day of the challenge (e.g., `/johnDoe/Day01`).
- Each day's folder should contain two subfolders: `Part1` and `Part2`, for the respective daily challenges.
- Feel free to use any programming language. Include a `.gitignore` file in your main folder to avoid committing unnecessary files.

```
### Example Structure:
/adventofcode2023
    /johnDoe
        /Day01
            /Challenge1
                solution.py
            /Challenge2
                solution.py
        /Day02
            /Challenge1
                solution.js
            /Challenge2
                solution.js
    /janeSmith
        /Day01
            ...
```
